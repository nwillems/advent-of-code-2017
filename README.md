# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017).

Originally, I had no intention to publish these files, but [at least one person has expressed interest](https://twitter.com/michielrutting/status/936892474433216512), so why not? These code files represent a balance between finding a solution fast, but still keeping the code acceptable and interesting to myself. I do tend to polish it a bit after I've found the solution, but before I commit it, but no aggressive refactoring takes place. Some of the code may be rough around the edges.
